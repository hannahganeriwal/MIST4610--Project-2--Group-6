## Describing your dataset and what data it contains:

Where was it obtained, what are the dimensions of it (rows and columns), what are the various columns, data types, etc. Describe it in sufficient detail so that an uninformed reader would understand the dataset.


## Question 1: 

### What are the leading causes of death from 1999-2017 and how can that correlate with advancements in medical treatments? Does the trend line suggest a change in the leading cause?

### Importance: 
This question is essential for evaluating the impact of medical advancements and public health interventions on population health outcomes. It can be significant to understand how mortality rates for specific causes of death, such as cancer and heart disease, which based on this data, are by far the 2 leading causes of death, have changed over time can provide insights into the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing, detecting, and treating these diseases. By correlating changes in mortality rates with advancements in medical treatments, screening programs and lifestyle interventions, we can thoroughly assess the progress made in reducing mortality from these diseases and identify areas for further improvement. 


### The manipulations applied to the data set as part of the analysis:
For this graph, we had to perform a few manipulations in order to get this outcome. This dataset was broken up by all the causes of death but also included one calculation which was the total sum of all causes, which we excluded to solely look at the individual causes or else our data set would have been skewed. To also get these exact results, we had to filter all the causes except cancer and heart disease. Additionally, we had to drag “trend lines” from the analytics tab in order to analyze the slope of the lines.

### Analysis and Results:	
Impact of Medical Advancements: By correlating changes in mortality rates for specific causes of death with advancements in medical treatments and public health interventions, the analysis assessed the effectiveness of interventions in reducing mortality from diseases like cancer and heart disease. 
This visualization is a trend line from 1999-2017 which provided insight into the temporal relationship between interventions and mortality outcomes. In 1999, the death rate for heart disease totaled to 13,059 and in 2017 it totaled to 8,466. Additionally, in 1999 for cancer, the total age adjusted death rate was 10,275 and in 2017 it was 7,905. 
We also analyzed a linear trend line for both death causes which is represented by a dashed line correlated to its relative color of cause. In Tableau, it was interesting to note how for heart disease the slope read -275 and for cancer the slope was -132. In this case for example, the intercept of -132 indicates that the age-adjusted death rate for cancer in 1999 was estimated to be 132 deaths per 100,000 population lower than what would have been expected based on the pre-existing trend. The decrease in age-adjusted death rates for both heart disease and cancer from 1999 to 2017 suggests a positive trend in mortality outcomes and that even without any further intervention, there would have been a decrease in death rates over time. 
Last thing to note that this graph provided insight on is that based on these trend lines, it is indicated that cancer will soon be the leading cause of death rather than heart disease. Based on the slopes that we analyzed, we can see that the decrease is much quicker for heart disease, which is why this projection is seen to be accurate. This compares to an article from the CDC stating, “Our projections indicate that cancer will soon become the leading cause of death in the United States if trends in risk of death from cancer and heart disease and population growth and aging continue” (CDC 2019) which aligns with our model.

## Question 2: 


### The manipulations applied to the data set as part of the analysis:
Were there any manipulations or calculations that needed to be performed on the data, what were they, describe the purpose and how they were accomplished.	


### Analysis and Results:	
Analyze and visualize the results of your analysis and describe the implications of your analysis. Please provide any citations if required as well as supporting visualizations and analysis generated from Tableau.
